# Initial scope of SAMPLICS

This document provides the initial scope of the SAMPLICS library. The initial scope is the list of topics that the first author and creator of the library was planning to include.

## Sample selection

- Simple random selection
- Systematic selection
- Probability proportional to size (PPS)
- Unequal probability of selection (Brewer's, Hanurav-Vijayan's, Murphy's)

## Sample weighting

- Design weight
- weight adjustment (e.g. non-response, normalization, trimming)
- Post-stratification and other calibration methods
- Replicate weights i.e. Bootstrap, BRR, Fay, Jackkniffe

## Estimation

- Expansion (Taylor) methods
- Replicate methods (i.e. Bootstrap, BRR, Fay, Jackkniffe)
- Regression parameters (linear, logistic and maybe other transformations)
- Frequency tables (one and two ways)

## Small area estimation

- Basic area (Fay-Herriot) level model
- Basic unit level model
