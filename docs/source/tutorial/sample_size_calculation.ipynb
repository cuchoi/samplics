    "## Sample size calculation for stage sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sections below, we illustrate a simple examples of sample size calculations in the context of household surveys using stage sampling designs. Let's assume that we want to calculate sample size for a vaccination survey in Senegal. We want to stratify the sample by administrative region. We will use the 2017 Senegal DHS to get an idea of the coverage rates for some main vaccine-doses. Below, we show vaccination coverage of hepatitis B birth dose (hepB0) vaccine, first and third dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP), first dose of measles containing vaccine (MCV1) and coverage of basic vaccination. Basic vaccination refers to the 12-23 months old children that received BCG vaccine, three doses of DTP containing vaccine, three doses of polio vaccine, and the first dose of measles containing vaccine.The table below shows the 2017 Senegal DHS vaccination coverage of a few vaccine-doses for children aged 12 to 23 months old.\n",
