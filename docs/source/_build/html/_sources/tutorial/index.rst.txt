Tutorial
========

Samplics is a Python package designed to be a comprehensive tool for selecting, weighting and analyzing survey sample data obtained from complex designs. The main objective of this tutorial is to take the user through the Samplics' APIs main features. We hope that after going through the tutorial, the user will have a good understanding of APIs' use cases. The tutorial is organized in several main topics. The user should be able to only focus on topics of interest. 

This tutorial is intended for users with basic knowledge of Python. It is assumed that the user has a basic understanding of Python syntax. Also, the tutorial is not intended to teach survey sampling methods. To learn survey sampling methods, we refer the user to the `UNStats Handbook 2005 <https://unstats.un.org/unsd/hhsurveys/>`_, `Designing Household Survey Samples: Practical Guidelines <https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/surveys/Series_F98en.pdf>`_, and the reference material mentioned throughout this tutorial. 


Datasets for the tutorial
-------------------------
The module *datasets* allows the user to load the datasets used in this tutorial. Note that the datasets are only used to illustrate the syntax and APIs of *samplics*. **Many of the datasets in this tutorial are subsets of actual samples but DO NOT represent these samples**. The datasets were subseted from existing samples to reduce the size of the files.  Each dataset is represented by a class with the members: *name*, *description*, *nrows*, *ncols*, *design*, *source*, and, *data*. The list of datasets are the following:

* **Birth**: This dataset represent a city data of categories of birth by age group. The dataset was obtained through the public stata API.
* **CountyCrop** and **CountryCropMeans**: These datasets were used by Battese, G.E., Harter, R.M. and Fuller, W.A. [#battese1988]_ for their pioner paper on small area estimation.
* **ExpenditureMilk**: The Milk Expenditure data contains 43 observations on the average expenditure on fresh milk for the year 1989. This dataset was originally used by Arora and Lahiri (1997) and later by You and Chapman (2006).
* **Nhanes2**, **Nhanes2brr**, **Nhanes2jk**: these datasets were obtained from the NHANES [#mcdowell1981]_. As mentioned above, the datasets are only subsets of the full sample and do not represent the NHANES II study. This data is only useful for illustrating the syntax of *samplics*. These datasets should not be used to conduct any analysis of NHANES nor use the numbers for any statistical analysis. The original data was obtained through the public stata API.
* **Nmihs**: The dataset is a subset of the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey (NMIHS) sample [#gonzalez1992]_. The dataset should not be used to conduct any analysis of NMIHS nor use the numbers for any statistical analysis. The original data was obtained through the public stata API.
* **PSUFrame**, **PSUSample**, **SSUSample**: these are simulated datasets to illustrate the selectionof primary and secondary sampling units.

Let's assume we want to load the PSU frame, we could write the following code.

.. code-block:: python

   import samplics

   # Import appropriate class.
   from samplics.datasets import PSUFrame

   # Instantiate an object to store the dataset and its metadata
   psu_frame_cls = PSUFrame()

   # Load the datasets to the class instance. 
   psu_frame_cls.load_data()

   # Store the datasets in the variable psu_frame (optional)
   psu_frame = psu_frame_cls.data

**Important**: The datasets should not be used for any statistical analysis. No number shown in this tutorial shall be used for any statistical analysis. All the examples are exclusively for illustrating the syntax of *samplics*.

Sample size calculation
-----------------------
Sample size calculation and allocation is usually one of the first steps in conducting a survey. Sample size calculations allow the survey implementers to collect enough data o achieve targeted precision levels. To do so, the sample size calculation should follow as close as possible the actual sampling design and take into account imperfections of survey implementations such as non response. Since sample sizes are calculated prior to implementing the survey, many of the input data needed to calculate sample sizes are obtained from previous experience and from reasonable assumptions. 

In this tutorial, we illustrate the calculation and allocation of some common sample size methods. Users can found additional details from Chow, S., Shao, J., Wang, H., Lokhnygina, Y. (2018) [#chow2018]_ and Ryan, T.P. [#ryan2013]_.

Sample selection
----------------

When a sample frame is available, the simple random sampling (srs) method is usually the easiest way to select a sample. However, operational and cost constraints often result in much more complex mechanisms for selecting samples. Common use cases of complex sampling designs are the national household surveys such as the `Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) <https://dhsprogram.com>`_, the `Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) <http://surveys.worldbank.org>`_, the `Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) <https://mics.unicef.org>`_, and many more. In the national household surveys, the sample is selected in stages. For example, at the first stage clusters of households are selected using probability proportional to size (pps) method, at the second stage households are selected from the sampled clusters, and at the final stage individuals are selected from households in the sample.  

In this tutorial, we generate simulated data to illustrate the first and second stage selections of clusters and households, respectively.

Sample weighting
----------------

The sample weighting is the mechanism that allows us to generalize the results from the sample to the target population. The design/base weights are obtained from the final probability of selection as their inverse. In large scale surveys, design weights are adjusted to account for non-response, for extreme values, or to ensure that auxiliary variables benchmark to known controls. 

The weighting tutorial is in two parts. The first part discusses several weight adjustments methods e.g. non-response adjustment, poststratification, calibration. The second part of the tutorial walks the user through the creation of replicate weights using Booststrap, Balanced Repeated Replication (BRR), and Jackknife methods.

Population parameters estimation
--------------------------------

Often the goal of conducting a survey is to estimate parameters of the target population from the survey sample. To appropriately estimate uncertainties associated with the sample estimates, the complex design must be taken into account. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to use the APIs to produce point estimates of mean, total, proportion and ratio parameters as well as their associated Taylor-based and replication-based measures of uncertainty. Wolter, K.M. (2007) [#wolter2007]_ provides a self-contained description of a number of techniques for variance estimation both Taylor and replication based.

Categorical data analysis
-------------------------

Categorical data analysis refers to the set of methods for analyzing categorical response variables. This is a large topic in data analysis and used in the context of complex survey sampling. Contingency tables or cross-tabulations with associated statistics are well-known categorical data analysis techniques. But categorical data analysis extends to more areas such as modeling techniques for categorical response variables e.g. logistic/logit/loglinear regressions and generalized linear mixed models for categorical responses. Agresti, Alan (2013) [#agresti2013]_ provides an overview of these methods.

Small Area Estimation (SAE)
---------------------------

SAE techniques can be considered as extensions of the survey estimation techniques that only use the sample data to produce estimates. Note that we include model assisted techniques such as the Generalized Regression (GREG) estimator in this category. These are often referred to as the direct estimates. In some applications, sample sizes are not large enough to produce reliable direct estimates for the domains of interest. In these situations, one possible way to improve the domain level estimates is to use SAE techniques which require availability of auxiliary information. Depending on the SAE method used, the auxiliary information needs to be available at the domains aggregated level or for non-sampled observations in the target population. SAE techniques produce modeled estimates of parameters of interest. There are two main categories of SAE methods that are the area level and the unit level, discussed in this tutorial.
